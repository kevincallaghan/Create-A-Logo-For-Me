## Credits

1. Node gitIgnore template was found on https://github.com/github/gitignore 

2. I learned that you could validate a prompt field inside the Inquirer array from a Stack Overflow article.  Here is a link to the article: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65189877/how-can-i-validate-that-a-user-input-their-email-when-using-inquirer-npm 

3. This website was very helpful with creating the SVG logo area, circle shape, and text code.  Here is a link to the page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Getting_Started 

4. The article "SVG Shape Elements: Polygons" on thenewcode.com had starter code that I copied and changed to make my triangle SVG shape.  Here is a link to the page:  http://thenewcode.com/1037/SVG-Shape-Elements-Polygons 

5.  The article "SVG Shape Elements: Rectangles and Squares" on thenewcode.com had starter code that I copied and changed to make my square SVG shape.  Here is a link to the page:  http://thenewcode.com/1034/SVG-Shape-Elements-Rectangles-and-Squares 

6. I watched the video "JavaScript Constructors" on Bro Code youtube channel to learn more and help with my Class Constructor for Shape.  Here is the link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaUFyK8M4WY
